Allow master to chat.
Auto-update chat for everyone who has logged in whenever anything appears in chat.
When logging in as spectator, ensure the name appears correctly (currently Player 1 or other) rather than "spectator."
Every character has a combination of 6 skillsets (accuracy, handling, defense, agility, strength, morale) and 3 for their broom (speed, maneuverability, stability).
These things can be edited only by the master on their dashboard (and not in coding). Even broom name and player name can be edited from there.
Track player mood/condition (e.g., fatigued, injured, motivated), which could affect gameplay.
Correct the word "commentator" and change it to "spectator."
The game proceeds by responding to actions by the spectator (which will be a bot generating random events like weather changes and interactions between players). Other players will choose actions via buttons.
